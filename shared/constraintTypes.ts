/**
 * The constraint-type library (TAXONOMY.md §7).
 *
 * WHY `shared/` AND NOT server/utils OR app/utils
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * Two consumers need the same list and must not drift:
 *
 *   server/utils/violations.ts   decides which types it can evaluate
 *   the rule builder UI          decides which types a tenant may configure
 *
 * If the UI's list ever gained a type the evaluator does not know, a tenant
 * could configure a rule that is silently never checked — a constraint that
 * exists, is enabled, shows no violations, and means nothing. Reading one
 * declaration from both sides makes that unrepresentable rather than merely
 * unlikely. `violations.ts` re-exports the two key lists so nothing else had to
 * change.
 *
 * NOT A DSL, BY DESIGN
 * --------------------
 * TAXONOMY.md §2: constraints are "predefined constraint types + parameters,
 * not a free-form expression DSL". A type here declares its parameters; the
 * builder renders exactly those. Adding a constraint type is a code change,
 * because a type with no evaluator is a promise nothing keeps.
